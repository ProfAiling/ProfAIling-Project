- Is it possible for a computer to collect our personal information from our written texts? 

- Can this be a possibility for platforms and social networks that make our data their personal gold mine?

Although these questions may worry and raise doubts related to the issue of privacy, the analysis
of written texts as a source of user data is certainly one of the most interesting possibilities nowadays. 

In our project, in particular, we will attempt to predict the gender and age of an individual from
his or her written text. 

Indeed, we believe that there are stylistic and content differences between different categories of subjects that may allow classification models to distinguish between different
classes of people.
